# HuffmanDecoder
This is a project I have developed to utilize a binary decoding algorithm that decodes and outputs the original encoded data.

Utilized in this project is multithreading and socket programming. 

A remote server is intended to run server.cpp and serve in the binary tree creation and the decoding of binary codes. 

The user client is inteded to run client.cpp and act as the constructor for the original encoded data.
